# GCP Dataflow Pipelines

In this repository, you will find a collection of data jobs that I have built using Google Cloud Platform's Dataflow service. It is a work in progress and I will be adding more pipelines as I build them.

## [Flex Template](https://github.com/amandeepsaluja/gcp-dataflow-pipeline/tree/master/01-flex-template)

In this project, I built a data job using Google Cloud Platform's Dataflow service. I created a custom Flex template to run a data job that read data from API, extract keys from JSON response, and write the results to a BigQuery table.
